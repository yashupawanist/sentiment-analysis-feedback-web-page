			<h1>Project Overview</h1>
			<p>The aim of this project is to develop a drug recommendation system that utilizes sentiment analysis to provide personalized drug recommendations to patients. The system will analyze patient reviews of drugs and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing techniques. It will then use machine learning algorithms to recommend drugs that have been rated positively by patients with similar sentiment.

                The system will be developed using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Seaborn and Mathplots. The data will be sourced from publicly available datasets of patient reviews of drugs. The system will be evaluated based on its accuracy in recommending drugs that have been rated positively by patients with similar sentiment.

			<p><h1> Project Details</h1><br>
               <h2> Problem Statement</h2><br>
                The current drug prescription process is based on a trial and error method, where healthcare providers prescribe drugs based on their experience and limited patient history. This process can be inefficient and may result in patients experiencing adverse effects or being prescribed ineffective drugs. The objective of this project is to develop a drug recommendation system that utilizes sentiment analysis to provide personalized drug recommendations to patients based on their sentiment analysis.
                <br><br>
               <h2>Data Collection</h2>
               <br>To train the machine learning model, we will need a dataset of patient reviews of drugs that includes information such as the drug name, review text, and patient sentiment. We will source this data from publicly available datasets such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit.
                <br><br>
               <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2><br>
                The collected data will need to be preprocessed to remove irrelevant information such as patient names and to transform the text data into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This will involve techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal. The preprocessed data will be split into training and testing datasets.
                <br><br>
                Sentiment Analysis
                The next step will be to perform sentiment analysis on the patient reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We will use techniques such as sentiment analysis using the Vader lexicon and sentiment analysis using machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
                <br><br>
                Drug Recommendation
                Once we have classified the patient reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, we will use machine learning algorithms such as Collaborative Filtering and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to recommend drugs that have been rated positively by patients with similar sentiment. This will involve building a drug recommendation model that considers factors such as drug efficacy, safety, and patient adherence.
                <br><br>
               <h2> Evaluation </h2><br>
                The performance of the drug recommendation system will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We will use techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the machine learning models used in the system.
                <br><br>
               <h2> Deployment</h2><br>
                The final step will be to deploy the drug recommendation system in a production environment. The system will be integrated into electronic health records (EHRs) or patient portals to provide personalized drug recommendations to patients based on their sentiment analysis. The system will be evaluated in a real-world setting to assess its impact on patient outcomes and healthcare provider workflow.
                <br><br>
              <h2>  Conclusion</h2><br>
                The drug recommendation system based on sentiment analysis using machine learning has the potential to improve patient outcomes by providing personalized drug recommendations based on patient sentiment. The system can also help healthcare providers to make more informed decisions when prescribing drugs and reduce the risk of adverse effects.</p>
